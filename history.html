		<div class="col-container" id="history">
			<div class="col">
				<p style="padding: 40px 100px 0px 100px;">The name <strong>Mumbai</strong> is an eponym, derived from the name of a local Goddess called <strong>Mumbadevi</strong>. The history of this beautiful city dates back to the formation of the seven islands, namely <strong>Colaba, Mazagaon, Mahim, Parel, Bombay Island, Worli</strong> and <strong>Old Woman's Island</strong>.</p>

				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 20px 30px;">The history of Mumbai deals with the growth of a collection of seven islands on the west coast of India to become the commercial capital of the nation, and one of the most populous cities in the world. Although human habitation existed since the Stone Age, the <strong>Kolis</strong>, a Marathi fishing community, were the earliest known settlers of the islands. The <strong>Maurya Empire</strong> gained control of the islands during the <strong>3rd century BCE</strong>, and transformed it into a centre of <strong>Hindu</strong> and <strong>Buddhist</strong> culture and religion. Later, between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: <strong>Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas,</strong> before being ruled by the <strong>Silharas</strong> from 810 to 1260.<br><br>
			
				After the death of <strong>Asoka</strong>, Bombay had been taken over by various Hindu rulers until <strong>1343</strong>. Mohammedans from Gujarat took the possession in the same year and ruled for nearly two centuries. Then came the <strong>Portuguese</strong> in <strong>1534</strong> and kept the name <strong>'Bom Baia'</strong>. Portuguese built many buildings, churches and forts at <strong>Sion, Mahim, Bandra, and Bassien</strong>.<br><br>

				<strong>The English East India Company</strong> took Mumbai on lease from the crown for an <em>annual sum of 10 pounds in gold</em> in the year <strong>1668</strong>. They shifted their headquarter from <strong>Surat</strong> to <strong>Mumbai</strong> in <strong>1687</strong>. They corrupted the <strong>Portuguese</strong> name <strong>'Bom Baia'</strong> to <strong>'Bombay'</strong>. <strong>Kolis</strong>, the original fisher-folk inhabitants of Mumbai used to call <strong>'Mumba'</strong> after <strong>Mumbadevi</strong>, the Hindu goddess. When <strong>Mr. Gerald Aungier</strong> became the governor of Bombay, he made the city more populous by attracting <strong>Gujarati traders, Parsi ship-builders, and Muslim and Hindu manufacturers</strong> from the mainland. <strong>Sir Robert Grant <em>(1779-1838)</em></strong> governor of Bombay from <strong>1835</strong> to <strong>1838 </strong>constructed a number of roads between Bombay and the hinterland. The first railway line of India between <strong>Victoria Terminus</strong> and <strong>Thana</strong> was inaugurated on <strong>16th April 1853</strong>.<br><br>

				<strong>The Great Indian Peninsular <em>(GIP)</em></strong> and the <strong>Bombay Baroda</strong> and <strong>Central India <em>(BB & CI)</em> Railway</strong> were started in <strong>1860</strong> and a regular service of steamers on the west coast was commenced in <strong>1869</strong>. After the Sepoy Mutiny or the First War of Independence, the East India Company was accused of mismanagement and the islands of Bombay were reverted to the British Crown.<br><br>

				Many buildings such as the <strong>Victoria Terminus, the General Post Office, Municipal Corporation, the Prince of Wales Museum, Rajabai Tower</strong> and <strong>Bombay University, Elphinstone College and the Cawasji Jehangir Hall, the Crawford Market, the Old Secretariat <em>(Old Customs House)</em></strong> and the <strong>Public Works Department (PWD)</strong> Building were constructed in the later half of the 19th century. The <strong>Gateway of India</strong> was built to commemorate the visit of <strong>King George V</strong> and <strong>Queen Mary</strong> for the <strong>Darbar</strong> at <strong>Delhi</strong> in <strong>1911</strong>. Historic All India Congress Committee session was started on <strong>7th of August 1942</strong> at <strong>Gowala Tank Maidan</strong>. <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> gave <strong><em>'Quit India'</em></strong> call at this session.<br><br>

				British arrested the Indian leaders soon afterwards but the momentum of the <strong>Quit India</strong> movement could not be stopped and led to the <strong>final withdrawal</strong> of the <strong>British</strong> on <strong>15 August 1947</strong>. After independence, the state of <strong>Bombay</strong> was split into <strong>Maharashtra</strong> and <strong>Gujarat</strong> states in <strong>1960</strong> on linguistic basis, while the former retaining Bombay city as its capital. The Congress party continued to rule Maharashtra until 1994 when the Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) replaced it. Later <strong>Bombay</strong> retained its original name <strong>Mumbai</strong>.</p>
